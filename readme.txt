== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I get the verification code? =

Go to either Google Webmaster Tools, Yahoo Site Explorer, or Bing Webmaster Center, find the option to add/verify a new site then select the meta option. You be provided with a piece of code and instructions to add it to your site.

= What do I do with the code once I have it? =

All you need is the actual content= code, the plugin will automatically format the meta tag when it inserts it.
Ex.: Google will give you a piece of code like this: <meta name='google-site-verification' content='dBw5CvburAxi537Rp9qi5uG2174Vb6JwHwIRwPSLIK8''>
You want to copy the code: dBw5CvburAxi537Rp9qi5uG2174Vb6JwHwIRwPSLIK8 and paste it in the input box for Google. If you’re still not sure just copy the whole string they give you, it should parse the code out for you.

= I’m using WPMU but I don’t want the plugin automatically activated for each site. Can I just put it in the wp-content/plugins directory so each blog owner can choose whether or not they want it activated? =
You sure can. Just be sure not to copy it into both locations.
